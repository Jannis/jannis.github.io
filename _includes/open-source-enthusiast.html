## Open Source Enthusiast

I believe in Open Source as a means of learning a lot about
communication and team work as well as developing and maintaining
publicly visible skills.

But more than anything it is&#8212;at least for me&#8212;a way of
contributing value to the world by sharing the results of your work
and allowing others to reuse it and learn from it.

Over the last decade I have been involved in various open source
projects:

* I used to be an active contributor to
  [Lunar Linux](http://lunar-linux.org), a source based Linux
  distribution, between 2005 and 2009
* I have been one of the core developers and leaders of the
  [Xfce desktop environment](http://xfce.org) since 2006 (although
  less and less since I started working)
* Some of my achievements, contributions and roles include:
    - Founding member and first president of the Xfce Foundation (likely
      to be replaced by an umbrella organisation)
    - Author of the
      [Xfce Release Model](http://xfce.org/about/releasemodel)
    - Release manager for
      [Xfce 4.8](http://www.xfce.org/about/news/?post=1295136000)
    - Coordinator of the
      [Xfce Goodies infrastructure](http://goodies.xfce.org)
    - Long-time maintainer of
      [Thunar](http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start), the Xfce file
      manager
    - Author of [Tumbler](http://git.xfce.org/xfce/tumbler/), the
      thumbnail service used on the Nokia N9 and in Xfce
    - Author of [Garcon](http://git.xfce.org/xfce/garcon/), Xfce's
      freedesktop.org-compliant desktop menu library
    - Author of [Moka](http://git.xfce.org/www/moka/), a Ruby/Sinatra
      web application for managing releases of Xfce software components
    - Reduced the maintenance effort and added support for remote file
      systems in Xfce by ported the majority of Xfce
      ([Thunar](http://git.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/),
      [xfdesktop](http://git.xfce.org/xfce/xfdesktop/),
      [thunar-volman](http://git.xfce.org/xfce/thunar-volman)) to
      GIO/GVfs
    - Other initiatives include moving all translators of Xfce to
      [Transifex](http://transifex.org) and launching the
      [Xfce Design SIG](http://wiki.xfce.org/design/start) in 2011
* I have given talks on
  [Xfce 4.6](http://lunar-linux.org/~jannis/xfce/fosdem-2009/fosdem-2009-xfce4.6-and-then.pdf)
  and
  [Tumbler](http://users.xfce.org/~jannis/xfce/fosdem-2012/2012-fosdem-tumbler.pdf)
  at [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org) 2009 and 2012
* I wrote both, my undergraduate and graduate thesis, about Open Source
  software:
    - Undergraduate thesis: Porting the Thunar File Manager to the
      Asynchronous Extensible Virtual File System Layer GIO, 2009
    - Graduate thesis: [Configurable Graph Drawing Algorithms for the Ti*k*Z Graphics Description Language](http://www.tcs.uni-luebeck.de/downloads/papers/2011/2011-configurable-graph-drawing-algorithms-jannis-pohlmann.pdf), 2011
* I have also contributed to:
    - [Ardour](http://ardour.org), where I rewrote the Wiimote remote
      control plugin and ported it to Ardour 3 in order to control
      Ardour from anywhere in the room during recording sessions
    - [Consonant](http://github.com/CodethinkLabs/consonant),
      an object-relational, cross-referenced, verifiable and
      service-oriented Git object store and web API, and its reference
      implementation
      [python-consonant](http://github.com/CodethinkLabs/python-consonant),
      both of which I designed and implemented
    - [Baserock](http://baserock.org), an open source project for
      distributed, traceable development, building and deployment
      of embedded software systems, launched by my former employer
      [Codethink](http://codethink.co.uk)
