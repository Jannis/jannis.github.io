## Autodidact Musician

I have taught myself how to play various instruments over the years and
tried my luck in a number of small underground bands, with music styles
ranging from Black Metal to Stoner and Post/Indie Rock.

Having moved around a fair amount recently, my current focus is the solo
project *Ufobuddha*.

Ufobuddha is energetic, loud, noisy and spacious rock that occasionally
drops into a state of melancholia.

I set no rules for what the music should sound like, so most songs exist
purely by virtue of jamming and experimenting.

A first album is planned for 2014.

### Zilov Gaps

<q>Zilov Gaps is guitars, electronics, basses, beats, drums, vocals,
synths, glockenspiels and more. Itâ€™s post-rock but with vox; electronica
but with guitars; shoegaze but with beats; melodic but with epic
noise-fests. It's the space between everywhere else, filled with
massive, wondrous noise.</q>

I joined Zilov Gaps (then called *The Detour*) as drummer in 2013
and stayed with them until I moved away from Manchester in 2014.
Together we played various gigs and festivals around Manchester and
Liverpool and recorded new song material.

### Jams &amp; Other Experiments

I try to record jam sessions as much as I can. Some of them are
available on my personal SoundCloud page.
