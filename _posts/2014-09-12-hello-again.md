It's been a while. I haven't been writing anything on this website since
late 2012, which makes nearly two years of inactivity. I had been planning
an update and redesign of the whole thing for a long time, so here we go.

Things have changed a little since 2012. I am no longer with
[Codethink](http://codethink.co.uk) and have, after having had a blast in
Manchester, moved back to Germany. I took a break from work to tour across
the country visiting friends, write music and spend time at music festivals.
Right now, I am working on launching my own business together with a good
friend whom some of you will know from the Xfce community.

It's this new endeavour that has led me to refreshing this website and
start writing again. We will be exploring many technologies over the
next few months and some of our findings and opinions will likely be
worth discussing and writing about.

I'm a little amused by how things have developed over time. Apart from
a few early attempts at writing code in BASIC, I started as a web
developer, moved on to the Linux desktop and worked on embedded for
years. As of today I will be focusing on the web again, except this
time there's a fair amount of mobile in the equation as well, which
didn't exist back when I started.

Exciting times all in all, so stay tuned!
